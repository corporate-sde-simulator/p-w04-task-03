# Meeting Notes - Sprint 26 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Vikram Patel (Lead), Deepak, Intern

---

## Leader election using Bully algorithm

- **Vikram Patel:** This is blocking our release. Deepak started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Deepak:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `bullyElection.go` and `nodeManager.go`
- [ ] @Deepak - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Vikram Patel - Final sign-off before merge
